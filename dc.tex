\subsection{Data Center} \label{sec:dc}

If we build a data center in honor of Jim Gray to support data science  it would have to be cloud based.
This would allow us to scale and allow more people to access more data sets than any other platform.

A data center alone would not be sufficient a core engineering team which supports a developer and a science platform would be needed.
Over all management of contracts and money would be needed.
\tabref{tab:dcost} includes an Engineering team, a management team and and a scientific support team.
