\section{Data Center details} \label{sec:dcdetail}
Here are some supporting calculations and thoughts for the data center presented in \secref{sec:dc}.


\subsection{Cloud cost estimate}\label{dec:cloudcost}
Storing a large volume of images and catalogs would be expensive on normal rates as shown in \tabref{tab:dr1cost}.
This should drop by 40-50\% with volume discounts and agreements e.g some public data sets are hosted at low or zero cost.
The DR1 costs is CPU not GPU based so AI would bring in higher costs and probably higher usage (the hours were includes).
If we assume something like \%45 in discounts agreements we get a likely cost as in the table.
If we use \tabref{tab:rubincost} as a lower bound and treat the full cost here as the upper bound a 3 point estimate gives an estimated cost for annual data center costs.

\input{dr1cost.tex}

The costs in \tabref{tab:dr1cost} are scaled from DP0 actual costs for March 2024 on google.
We should bear in mind almost no discounts remained by March 2024 on our agreement so this is an upper bound cost.

\input{dp0cost.tex}

\subsection{Lower bound}
The average annual running cost of Rubin USDF hardware would be a lower bound since we would want at least the Rubin data and probably more compute.
The average annual Rubin cost with some hardware support estimated is shown in \tabref{tab:rubincost}.
